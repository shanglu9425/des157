                    <p>I designed a music player for this studio project. I used jQuery and d3.js to help achieve the design and function. d3.js is quite powerful, and I was able to create data visulization through this library. I used d3.js to create a
                        bar chart, then I linked it with my music file to create this music visulization. jQuery is also quite useful, since it reduced my js workload by simplifing my process of writting js.

                    <img src="image/valentine.jpg" alt="glassdoor">
                    <p>For my user interface design, I designed a scrolling website to interact with users. When users scroll down along the page, they will trigger animation. The navigation also interacts with scrolling, if you scroll up and down, navigation
                        will fade in and fade out. I want use the scroll method to make the website more interactie, and I aslo provide fixed nav to help user navigate through the page.

                    <img src="image/screenShotMe.jpg" alt="glassdoor">
                    <p>For my user interface design, I tried to keep it simple as possible because I believe too much information like buttons will distract users when they interact with my interface. If you look closely, there are only three major components
                        in my design. The background, my self-illustration, and the spinning buttons.
                    </p>
                    <p> To make my interface more interactive, I added CSS animation to it, and I also implemented with some hover effect when uers clicking the buttons. If users click any spinning button, my self-illustration will change as well according
                        to the different images that pop out.

                    <h3>Critical Evaluation of Form</h3>
                    <img src="image/google.jpg" alt="glassdoor">
                    <p>Every time I login into my Gmail account, I have to go through this portal. According to Bill Derouchey's article/slideshow on interface design, this form's interface does fulfill the needs of priority, clarity, and purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p> Based on this screenshot, we can easily what is priority. The modal in the center where you have to input your email. I also like how Google product is implementing its material design concept. The login modal has nice shadow and color
                        contrast which looks like a piece of paper material sticking on the screen, and Google came up with this kind of design by studying real life material and incorporating these materialâ€™s propriety into their interface and icon design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This interface also fulfills the needs of clarity. You can see the color blue that is indicating where you should click to go next and the profile icon that is telling you if you are logging in the right account. The interface design also shows purpose,
                        by looking at the icon and headers users instantly know what this interface is for, and there is no confusing since everything is simple and easy to understand.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Effective User Interface</h3>
                    <img src="image/glassdoor.jpg" alt="glassdoor">
                    <p>I used glassdoor on daily basis because I like to look up at different companies and compare their salary and benefits. I also use glassdoor to help me prepare my coming up interviews because its effective user interface allows me
                        to find what I need immediately. The UI provides a useful nav bar which has different tabs that direct me to specific pages. The statistic graphs also give me an overview on the company with filtered tags that organized different
                        job positions. I also like how glassdoor divides different information into individual sections which prevent information from overwhelming users. The overall interface design turn the website into a web application where user
                        customize different functions and set up preference. The consistency of the design is also highly standarded, for examples, the font size and color.
