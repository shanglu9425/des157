                My topic research is about how to educate consumers on recycling and sustainability. To achieve this, we will need a more interactive method to teach consumers while they are performing their shopping tasks. This new method will allow consumers to know
                how sustainable are the products that they purchased, and in what ways can these products be recycled. By introducing this information to the consumers, they can make more educated decision based sustainability and environmental issues.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px">
                Study shows 32% of North American consumer make their sustainable purchase decision based on the packaging information to make sure if the manufacturers are committed to bring positive social and environmental impacts. In conclusion, consumers do put
                social and environmental impacts into their consideration, but they often need information about the products to determine whether they are eco-friendly or not (Global Consumers).

                As I mentioned earlier that encouraging people to become socially-conscious shoppers can be tough because they generally don’t hold any knowledge about products that they are going to purchased. For examples, it suitability and recyclability. Although
                a product seems environmental friendly, but its production or ingredients might cause some environmental concern. The GoodGuide app and website actually provided solution to help consumer learn about different products. By simply searching
                the specific item or scanning the bar code, the users will be able to see the ratings and reviews based on factors like health, environment, and community (Let us guide you). For my product I first decided to implement QR code to store
                information regarding different products. But I am also looking for an alternative way to do that. I was looking at Vivino Wine Scanner for inspiration. This app allows you to learn about a wine by taking a picture of its brand. The app
                will display its basic description and its price. I am currently into Microsoft Tag because it has similar functionality as QR Codes, but it is much faster and can store more data. Google Goggles is also a useful tool since it works like
                Google search but instead of typing words, you take a photo to search (Future Alternatives).
