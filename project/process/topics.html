            <h4>Interested Topic 1: Bio creation and data
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am really interested on how bio creation can help improve the sustainability in our world today. We already know some of the human waste can directly go to farming industry as fertilizer, and organization like UC Davis also use “the biodigester” to
                generate renewable energy. Like we put nutrition labels and detailed description on the different products, we can also provide information or data on how much a product can be recycled or reused, and based on the percentage we can rate
                a product based on its suitability. Through this process, we can directly educate and persuade our consumers to use more sustainable products.

            <h4>Interested Topic 2: Critical perspective on use of technology for peace
            </h4>
            <p>
                We are living in a most peaceful ear, however, there are always conflicts happening around the world that keep threaten our peace. I believe the main reason for those conflicts is the lack of communication. If we can improve our communication (by any
                means), most of the conflicts will be resolved. We can create different channels for communication and through people’s phones and computers we can help bring the voice out to the public.

            <h4>Interest Topic 3: Media art, landscape and heritage
            </h4>
            <p>
                I believe many culture and heritage sites might disappear eventually, and it is really a matter of time. How we preserve those culture and heritage sites are a great challenge presented to us. I think by utilizing the technology we have to day, we might
                be able to preserve them through a digital way, for example, the 3D computer generated modal and virtual reality technology.
