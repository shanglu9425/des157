               First user was a little confused about app, and she was clicking almost anything to find out app's purpose. She also had some
               diffculties to figure out how to use the app. For example, the function that allows her to scan QR code seems to be a painpoint to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second user was much more comfortable in using the app than the first user. It looks like she has some experience using the app that has QR code scanner function.
                She really likes the visual design, but she was a little bit confused the page where I show the result of the product, since she was not sure what result mean.
            </p>
             <p>
                Third user was pretty much like the second user but she cared more about the contents in the page, especially, the result page. She was suggesting I put more information
                regarding the product.
            </p>
             <p>
                I learned a lot from the user testing. I realized that a simple guide is necessary to help users understand this app better. Also, I should avoid put too much non-ink information that I
                included in app, so users won't click randomly to figure app's functions.
