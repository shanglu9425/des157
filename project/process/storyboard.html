             is working. Based on the storyboard, they can also learn when and where to use the application,

             The environment of the storyboard takes place at the super market. Customer has trouble choosing which product to buy because
             both products are the same and have same price. Therefore, the customer uses my scanner app to look up each product's sustainability in order to make a better decision.
