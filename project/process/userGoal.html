            <h4>User Goal
            </h4>
            <p>
                Based on interview and observation, we realized that users like to explore the function by themselves. They tend to 
                avoid instruction because it stops their work flow and often create distraction. In order to make user understand the project, 
                we need to make sure the application is intuitive, however, background knowledge is required for users to know in order to  
                make sure users understand the primary objectives. The application seems to user friendly, since it doesn't require too much 
                complicated process to interact with. What users needed are just a QR code and a phone to scan the QR code in order to get the 
                information.
