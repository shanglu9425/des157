               For my project I want to relate to how we can protect environment. By educating how the consumers
               through a shopping app, the users can know what percentage of the products go back to recycle. I plan
               to use a scanner plugin so the users can scan or take a picture of their items to learn about how it will
               be recycled. I also want to this app to be mainly used on the phone, so I will make sure my UI design is 
               more mobile friendly, but user can also interact with the desktop verison, such as information regarding
               recycle tips, and what kind of products and practice consumers should avoid in order to help protect environment.
